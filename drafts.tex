\section{Learning a Conservative Model}
We follow Wang's~\shortcite{wang1994learning,wang1995learning} approach for learning a STRIPS model from observation and interactions. For every action $a$ that was used in the observed trajectories ($\mathcal{T}$) a triplet of the form 
$\langle P, a, D\rangle$, where $P$ is the state before $a$ was applied and $D$ is the {\em delta state}, which represents the difference between $P$ and the state observed after applying $a$ to $P$. Formally, a delta-state is a pair $\langle add, del \rangle$, where $\mathtt{add}$ and $\mathtt{DEL}$ are conjunction of literals that describe the facts added to and deleted from $P$ in the state observed after $a$ was performed. %are both conjuncts of ground literals describing the literals that are added to and deleted from the pre-state after the operator is applied. The delta-state is the dierence between the post-state and pre-state

%$\langle s, a, s'\rangle$ is generated for every occurence of $a$ in $\mathcal{T}, such that $s$ is the state before applying $a$ and $s'$ is the state afterwards. 


From the set of observed trajectories, we extract triplets of the form $\langle s, a, s'\rangle$

They maintain for each action $a$ two sets of possible preconditions: the set of most specific preconditions ($S(a)$) and the set of most general ($G(a)$) preconditions. 

Under some simplifying assumptions, which we outline below, the set of most specific preconditions $S(a)$ consists a sufficient condition for executing $a$. Under this condition, any plan that uses $S(a)$ as the set of preconditions to $a$ is guaranteed to find the goal, resulting in a sound yet incomplete solution. 

The interesting questions are: how to compute $Sa(a)$, what are the assumptions that are required for $S(a)$ to indeed be sufficient precdonios, and how many trajectories are needed to provide some guarantee of completeness. We address these questions below. 


%(no negative preconditions, no noise, full observability), it holds that the real preconditions of $a$ are a superset of $G(a)$ and a subset of $S(a)$. Thus, we can solve the model-free planning problem by generating a plan that assumes the preconditions in $S(a)$ are the true preconditions. Since they are sufficient condition, we know that the plan will succeed. 


%, $S(a)$ and $G(a)$, where $S(a)$ is a set of facts that are sufficient preconditions and $G(a)$ is a set of facts that are required preconditions. They refer to these sets as the set of most specific ($S(a)$) and the set of most general ($G(a)$) preconditions. Under some simplifying assumptions (no negative preconditions, no noise, full observability), it holds that the real preconditions of $a$ are a superset of $G(a)$ and a subset of $S(a)$. Thus, we can solve the model-free planning problem by generating a plan that assumes the preconditions in $S(a)$ are the true preconditions. Since they are sufficient condition, we know that the plan will succeed. 


We propose a conservative approach to solve the model-free planning problem
that first learns a partial model from the given trajectories and then uses it to generate a plan that is guaranteed to reach the goal. For a real, unknown, planning problem $\Pi^*=\langle P,A,I,G\rangle$ we will analyze the observed trajectories to learn the following planning problem $\Pi_L=\langle P,A_L,I,G\rangle$, where $A_L$ is the learned actions. 
Ideal
We aim that $A_L$ will 


From the set of observed trajectories ($\mathcal{T}$), we extract the set of actions that were part of the observed trajectories, 
denoted by $A(\mathcal{T})$. Formally,
\[ A(\mathcal{T})=\{a | \exists T\in\mathcal{T} \text{~such that~} a\in T\} \]
Next, we generate for action $a\in A(\mathcal{T})$ a set of preconditions and effects, by considering the states that were before and after $a$ in the trajectories where it appears. 
Let $T(a)$ be the set of trajectories in $\mathcal{T}$ in which $a$ appeared, i.e., 
\[ T(a)=\{T | T\in \mathcal{T} \text{~and~} a\in T\} \]


We define the preconditions and effects of $a$, denoted $pre(a)$ and $eff(a)$, respectively, as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Preconditions.} The intersection of predicates that were true in all the state that preceded $a$ in the given trajectories $\mathcal{T}$. 
    \item {\bf Effects.} The difference, predicates, between states immediately before $a$ and states immediately after $a$. 
\end{itemize}

The effects are, of course, the real effects of $a$. However, the preconditions are a superset of the preconditions of $a$. Thus, every plan generated with these actions is a valid plan in the real model, but we might not find a plan we can generate even though such exists. 

MAYBE TALK ABOUT COSTS (E.G., ALL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO A LINEAR EQUATION, IF WE HAVE THE COSTS OF THE TRAJECTORIES)
% hich learns from the observed trajectories a partial model that is ``safe'' to use in planning.  This results in a model that can generate a subset of the plans that the original, unknown, model can generate, but the generated plan are guaranteed to be applicable.

We use the bounds in Equation~\ref{eq:pre} and~\ref{eq:eff} to 
transform a given conformant model-free planning problem $\Pi_\mathcal{T}$ 
to a fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning problem~\cite{daniele1999strong,muise2012improved},

solve a given conformant model-free planning problem $\Pi_\mathcal{T}$ by transforming it to a fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning problem~\cite{daniele1999strong,muise2012improved} $F(\Pi_\mathcal{T})$ such that every to $F(\Pi_\mathcal{T})$

and show how solving this FOND problem is related to solutions of the given conformant model-free planning problem.  
as follows. 



We denote by $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ the set of ``upper bound'' on the preconditions of $a$ 
given in Equation~\ref{eq:pre} (i.e., $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)=\bigcap_{\tuple{s, a, s'}\in \mathcal{T}(a)} s$). 
Given these bounds on the facts in the pre-conditions and effects, we propose a {\em conservative} approach to solve the model-free planning problem. In this approach, we create a planning problem that has the same predicates, initial state, and goal condition as the conformant model-free planning problem. Its actions are all the actions observed in $\mathcal{T}$. The preconditions of an action are the ``upper'' bound preconditions $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(\cdot)$. The effects are non-deterministic, and consist of any possible combination of add and delete effects in the bounds.

. Similarly, we denote $add_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$, $add_\mathcal{T}^l(a)$, $del_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$, and $del_\mathcal{T}^l(a)$, as the upper and lower bounds of the add and delete effects. 



For convenience, we denote by $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ the set of ``upper bound'' on the preconditions of $a$ given $\mathcal{T}$. Similarly, we denote $add_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$, $add_\mathcal{T}^l(a)$, $del_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$, and $del_\mathcal{T}^l(a)$, as the upper and lower bounds of the add and delete effects. 


Given these bounds on the facts in the pre-conditions and effects, we propose a {\em conservative} approach to solve the model-free planning problem. In this approach, we create a planning problem that has the same predicates, initial state, and goal condition as the conformant model-free planning problem. Its actions are all the actions observed in $\mathcal{T}$. The preconditions of an action are the ``upper'' bound preconditions $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(\cdot)$. The effects are non-deterministic, and consist of any possible combination of add and delete effects in the bounds. 

\subsection{Conformant Planning}
There are several effective fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planners~\cite{cimatti2003weak,kissmann2009solving}. We aim, however, to find a  solution to our non-deterministic planning problem that is guaranteed to be applicable. This is known as requiring a ``strong plan'' in the FOND literature. A particularly related type of FOND is {\em conformant planning}. Conformant planning can be seen as a middle ground between classical planning and full-blown planning under uncertainty (e.g., MDPs). It supports two forms of uncertainty -- uncertainty about the initial state, and non-deterministic action outcomes -- and aims to find a plan that is guaranteed to reach the goal.

% Maybe add a def. of conformant planning and make all the mapping more formal

% Now we can have a conformant planning problem and solve it



%Given these bound on the facts in the pre-conditions and effects, we can devise a {\em conformant planning} problem that, if solveable, will guarantee a solution to the model-free planning problem. Conformant planning can be seen as a middle ground between classical planning and full-blown planning under uncertainty (e.g., MDPs). It supports two forms of uncertainty: uncertainty about the initial state, and non-deterministic action outcome. % Maybe add a def. of conformant planning and make all the mapping more formal

% Mapping model-free to conformant planning
The conformant planning problem that corresponds to a given conformant model-free planning problem $\tuple{P,I,G, \mathcal{T}}$ has the same set of predicates ($P$) and goals ($G$). It has a single possible initial state ($I$), i.e., there is no uncertainty over the initial state. Its actions are all the actions observed in the observed trajectories $\mathcal{T}$. The preconditions of an action $a$ are $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$. The effects are non-deterministic, and consist of any possible combination of 
add and delete effects that is within the bounds of Equation~\ref{eq:bounds}. A solution to a conformant planning problem is a {\em conformant plan} -- a sequence of actions that is guaranteed to achieve the goal regardless of the uncertainty in the initial condition and in the nondeterministic effects of actions. Thus, a solution to the conformant planning outlined above is necessarily a sound solution to the corresponding model-free planning problem. 


% Something about the difficulty of solving 
This approach of mapping of conformant model-free planning to regular  conformant planning is sound but not complete: if no solution was found for the conformant planning problem it still may be the case the conformant model-free planning has a solution. 

\subsection{Known Effects}

%Following Walsh and Littman~\shortcite{walsh2008efficientLearning}, we consider in the rest of this paper a setting in which action effects are known and the uncertainty only stems from the overconservative set of preconditions. To motivate this special case, observe that $add_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ can only be incorrect if there is a predicate that is an add effect and it existed in all the pre-states of $a$.     Similarly, $del_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ is incorrect only if there is a predicate that is a delete effect     and did not exists in any of the pre-states of $a$. While possible, there are many planning domains that prevent this from occuring by verifying that deleted predicates are in the pre-state and added predicates are not already in the pre-state.  
The above approach for solving the conformant model-free planning problem is incomplete because of two causes: an over-conservative estimate of actions' effects or an over-conservative estimate of actions' preconditions. Under certain conditions, the learned ``upper'' bound on the effects ($add_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ and $del_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$) is exactly the effects of $a$. These conditions are:
(1) if a predicate $f$ is a delete effect of an action $a$ then $f$ is a precondition of $a$, 
(2) if a predicate $f$ is an add effect of $a$ then $f$ must be mutually exclusive with a precondition of $a$. 
These conditions are natural in many planning domains and Walsh and Littman~\shortcite{walsh2008efficientLearning} studies this special case in which actions' effects are known and the only uncertaitly is over actions' preconditions. 
%Walsh and Littman~\shortcite{walsh2008efficientLearning} considered a special case for learning an action model from trajectories, where action effects are known and the uncertainty only stems from the overconservative set of preconditions. In fact, under certain conditions, $add_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$  and $del_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ are exactly the effects of $a$. 

% In the rest of this paper we adopt this special case, and motivate it as follows. Observe that $add_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ can only be incorrect if there is a predicate that is an add effect and it existed in all the pre-states of $a$.     Similarly, $del_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$ is incorrect only if there is a predicate that is a delete effect     and did not exists in any of the pre-states of $a$. While possible, there are many planning domains that prevent this from occuring by verifying that deleted predicates are in the pre-state and added predicates are not already in the pre-state.  

In this case of known effects, there is a much simpler sound and incomplete approach to solving the model-free problem. Instead of compiling the problem to a conformant planning problem, we now compile it to a classical planning problem, having the same initial state, goal state, set of predicates, and actions. The only difference is that the actions' preconditions are the over-conservative sets $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$. It is easy to see that a solution to this problem will also be a solution to the model-free planning problem. However, this approach is incomplete, since $a$'s precondition can be a subset of $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$. This can result in the planner thinking that it cannot apply $a$ in a state that does not contain all the predicates in $pre_\mathcal{T}^u(a)$, even though $a$'s actual precondition would have allowed it to perform $a$ in that state. 


In the rest of this paper we focus on the case of known effects and address the following key question: how likely it is that the above approach is incomplete, i.e., will not find a solution to the conformant model-free planning problem even though one exists. We answer this question in the next section.
